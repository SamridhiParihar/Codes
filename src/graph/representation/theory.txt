Two ways :
    1. Adjacency Matrix  ( it can be used for smaller graphs but not used
                               because it ends up taking more space than required )
    2.  Adjacency List



    Representation	    Space	Edge        lookup	Iterating neighbors
    Adjacency Matrix	O(V²)	O(1)	           O(V)
    Adjacency List	    O(V+E)	O(deg(v))	     O(deg(v))
