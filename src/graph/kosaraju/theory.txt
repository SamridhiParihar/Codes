Kosaraju Algorithm :
    - It is only for strongly connected graph
    - thought process is :
        i. reversal of each node won't impact the scc ( they can still be intact )
        ii. to cater the starting point in scc , sorting wrt to finishing time will work

    - alogrithm :
        -- sort the edges based on finishing time
        -- reverse all the edges of the graph ( reverse the graph )
        -- Do the DFS
