Given :
    An  undirected , weighted graph with N node and M edges

Spanning Tree:
    A Tree in which :
        1. N nodes and N-1 edges
        2. all nodes are reachable from each other
    For Minimum Spanning Tree :
        - considering all spanning tree with minimum possible total edge weight


Prim's Algorithm:
    Greedy is the intuition behind it

DSU(Disjoint Set Union):
    - it can find if two nodes belongs to same set or not in o(1) tc which would be done by
        dfs in o(v+e) tc
    - helps in determining parents
    - works for dynamic graph ( graph changing at different steps )
    - I.Union:
        1. By Rank
        2. By Size
    -II.Find Parent
    - steps: for all edges (u-v)
        : find ultimate parent of u and v that is pu and pv
        : find ranks of ultimate parent
        : connect the smaller rank with larger rank
            if ranks are equal connect anyone to anyone and increase the parent rank
      : at last just find parents for everyone
        :Tc: O(4*alpha) nearly constant because alpha value is nearly 1
            α(n) is the inverse of the Ackermann function, a function that grows super fast.
            But its inverse grows unbelievably slowly.
            The Practical Meaning of α(n)
            Even for n = number of atoms in the universe (~10⁸⁰):
            α(n) ≤ 4
            Yes. Literally 4.
            For every practical value of n you will ever see in CP or real world:
            α(n) = 4 (or less)
            So DSU operations are effectively:
            Almost O(1)


** note (In DSU) **
    just make sure to use either unionByRank or unionBySize don't use both of them together
